Welcome! I’m Hasin Rehana (she/her), a PhD researcher working at the intersection of **Natural Language Processing**, **Biomedical Informatics**, and **Multimodal AI**. My work focuses on developing scalable deep learning pipelines that extract, represent, and integrate insights from biomedical text and imaging data to support clinical decision-making.

🔬 My research brings together Large Language Models (LLMs) like **BERT, GPT, and LLaMA** with real-world biomedical challenges such as:

- 🧬 **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** for vaccine adjuvants and proteins  
- 🔄 **Relation Extraction** for protein–protein and drug–disease interactions  
- 🩻 **Multimodal Learning** combining CT imaging with EHR text for surgical planning  

---

### 🧠 Current Focus

- Developing a **multimodal AI framework** for risk prediction in high-stakes procedures like TAVR  
- Leveraging LLMs for **biomedical literature mining** and **clinical knowledge graph construction**  
- Fine-tuning transformer models in **low-resource biomedical NLP settings**
